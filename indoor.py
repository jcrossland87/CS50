# indoor.py

# In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase.
# Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged.
# Youâ€™re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.

input_text = input("Input in UPPERCASE to convert to lowercase ")

# Change single spaces to triple periods

output_text = input_text.lower()

# Print changed UPPERCASE input as lowercase output

print(output_text)


# upper_lower = input("Input in UPPERCASE to convert to lowercase ").lower()

# print("Converted your input in UPPERCASE to lowercase ", upper_lower)
